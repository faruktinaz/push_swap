# push_swap
This project will make you sort data on a stack, with a limited set of instructions, using
the lowest possible number of actions. To succeed youâ€™ll have to manipulate various
types of algorithms and choose the most appropriate solution (out of many) for an
optimized data sorting.

The possible actions are:

pa (push A): Take the first element at the top of B and put it at the top of A. Do nothing if B is empty.
pb (push B): Take the first element at the top of A and put it at the top of B. Do nothing if A is empty.
sa (swap A): Swap the first 2 elements at the top of stack A. Do nothing if there is only one or no elements.
sb (swap B): Swap the first 2 elements at the top of stack B. Do nothing if there is only one or no elements.
ss: sa and sb at the same time.
ra (rotate A): Shift all elements of stack A up by 1. The first element becomes the last one.
rb (rotate B): Shift all elements of stack B up by 1. The first element becomes the last one.
rr: ra and rb at the same time.
rra (reverse rotate A): Shift all elements of stack A down by 1. The last element becomes the first one.
rrb (reverse rotate B): Shift all elements of stack b down by 1. The last element becomes the first one.
rrr : rra and rrb at the same time.
